Finally got time to build my own website on [Github](https://github.com/). This is my first post and I would like to thanks [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) which provided with a wonderful repository to help me get started with building this website.

I am intending to use this website to publish blogs, workshop and portfolio in Data science field.

Will see you guys in next post.
